# Plantbox
This Python Program is based on Gphoto2 which controls many types of camera models 
via USB. Gphoto2 runs via the command line, it was adapted to work with python here. 
This program was created by following the instructions on this YouTube video.

Other than the fucntions achived in that youtube video this program also triggers 
a 2 channel relay in order to control both studio lighting as well as a grow light 
in order to timelapse the growth of a plant. The grow light turns  off during
the photo while the studio light is turned on. The grow light also uses the 
datetime function to see if it is daytime.
